ANi started with a phone call. Dilan Swain, CEO and Founder, having spent the last 5 years at Creative Artists Agency, wanted to put his producing skills from Chapman University to good use. He was developing a project that focused on showcasing up and coming directors and completely undiscovered actors and actresses, but he needed help finding them.

> This boilerplate is a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you, developed by Dinesh Pandiyan.

<dl>
  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more, today.</dd>

  <dt>Component Specific Styles</dt>
  <dd>Separate styles for each component. Style in the good old scss way but still keep it abstracted for each component.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>

But wait... there's more!

  - *The best test setup:* Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
    changes. (Seen a react app with 99% test coverage before?)
  - *The fastest fonts:* Say goodbye to vacant text.
  - *Stay fast*: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
    line!
  - *Catch problems:* TravisCI setup included by default, so your
    tests get run automatically on each code push.

## Info

These are the things I stripped out from [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) - _github project rules, ngrok tunneling, shjs, service worker, webpack dll plugin, i18n, styled-components, code generators and a few more._
